# Yewi Component Examples

Here are a collection of stand alone working examples for each component

- [`Transitions`](transitions)
- [`Table`](table)
- [`Access`](access)
- [`Forms`](form)

Each `example` has a `package.json` that supplies 2 basic commands for running examples.
First, `npm run build` to generate the `wasm` files in `static/build` and then `npm start`
to run the local server at `http://localhost:5000`.
